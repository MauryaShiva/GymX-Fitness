Of course. You are right, the `README` should be specifically for your open-source API project and explain its usage limits.

Here is a complete, professional `README.md` file for your API's GitHub repository. It explains what the API does, how to use it, and includes the important note about the Vercel free plan.

# ExerciseDB API - v1 (Open Source)

A free, public, and open-source REST API for fitness exercises, featuring over 1,300 structured exercises with animated GIF-based visual media.

This project provides a clean, developer-friendly interface to a comprehensive exercise dataset, perfect for personal projects, learning, and building community-driven fitness applications.

**Live API Base URL:** `https://testings-nine.vercel.app`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Notice

This API is hosted on a **Vercel Hobby Plan**, which is free but has usage limits (e.g., 100 GB-hours/month of serverless function execution).

It is intended for **demonstration, personal projects, and non-commercial use**.

If you plan to use this API in a production application or expect high traffic, it is strongly recommended that you **fork this repository and deploy your own instance**. This will give you your own usage quota and ensure the stability of your application.
